Transactions don't work, but you can see where I was going with them. I would have also moved some of the classes to separate files for neatness / organization (was just prototyping it all in same file), but I spent too much time figuring out how to get node to do input/output from stdin/out (never had to do this before!)
<br><br>
Also, wanted to do an index implementation that would have changed numEqualTo (map of values to list of keys)

to run:
<br><br>
npm i<br>
tsc<br>
node app<br>
